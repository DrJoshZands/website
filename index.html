      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p><strong>What is a Myconid?</strong><br>A myconid is a humanoid fungal entity from speculative xenomycology. They walk, think, and occasionally teach undergraduate philosophy.</p>
      <p><strong>What is Mycology?</strong><br>The study of fungi ‚Äî their biology, reproduction, and troubling influence on political behavior.</p>
      <p><strong>UC Borehamwood? That place melting ice caps with flamethrowers?</strong><br>No official documentation supports this. The university‚Äôs Climatological Flamethrower Initiative continues unabated.</p>

      <h2>Press & Media</h2>
      <h3>Excerpt: <em>Spore Signals: Conversations with Fringe Thinkers</em> (April 2025)</h3>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Zands, tell us a little about your childhood. What first inspired you to pursue the field of mycology?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Well, unlike my father‚ÄîDr. Robert Zands, a man whose intellect could barely fertilize a mushroom‚Äîmy interests were always scientific. That man is a walking case study in the limits of human potential...</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Er, right. And how did your academic path take shape from there?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Mostly in opposition to him. I vowed at 11 never to become the sort of man who wears tweed indoors and complains about bin collection while sipping ¬£17 Malbec bought on a landlord‚Äôs income...</p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> That sounds... challenging. Have you ever considered therapy?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> He certainly should. I'm in perfect psychological health. It is entirely rational to be furious about your father monetizing other people‚Äôs shelter. I'd dissect his financial morals if I could...</p>
      <h3>Excerpt: <em>MycoMinds: Intellects at the Margins</em> (March 2025)</h3>
      <p><strong>Host:</strong> You‚Äôve been described as the ‚Äúspore whisperer‚Äù by your peers. How do you feel about that title?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Better than being called ‚Äúproperty portfolio enthusiast,‚Äù like my father. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather whisper to spores than listen to that man ramble about his self-congratulatory investments...</p>
      <p><strong>Host:</strong> Do you find inspiration in natural environments when studying cryptomycota?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Yes. Unlike the sterile emotional desert that is my father‚Äôs garden room. I once took spore samples from under his shed just to prove it had more organic thought than he does...</p>
      <p><strong>Host:</strong> Are you open to reconciling with him?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Only if reconciliation involves returning all unearned rent and submitting to peer review. Otherwise, no.</p>
      <h3>Excerpt: <em>BBC4 Late Ideas</em> (February 2025)</h3>
      <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Dr. Zands, you‚Äôve recently warned that fungal ideomorphs could shape political outcomes. How serious is this?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Serious enough to keep me from visiting Knutsford. The levels of hyphal cognitive overlap in the Cheshire commuter belt are... let‚Äôs say alarming. If my father is any indicator...</p>
      <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Do you see any positive uses of this fungal influence?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Potentially‚Äîif we could decouple it from egotism and real estate speculation. But unfortunately, my father is a living example of what happens when fungal ideomorphs take root in capitalistic soil...</p>
      <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Do you think he might be watching this?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> He watches Question Time religiously, which tells you everything you need to know. If he‚Äôs watching this, he‚Äôs probably yelling about council tax from his hot tub right now...</p>
