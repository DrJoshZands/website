      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Dr. Joshbert Zands is the founding professor of Crypto-zoonotic-micro-mycology at UC Borehamwood. He discovered <em>Porphyromyces indignatus</em>, the ideological fungus now feared and misunderstood across academic and political circles alike.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p><strong>What is a Myconid?</strong><br>A myconid is a humanoid fungal entity from speculative xenomycology. They walk, think, and occasionally teach undergraduate philosophy.</p>
      <p><strong>What is Mycology?</strong><br>The study of fungi ‚Äî their biology, reproduction, and troubling influence on political behavior.</p>
      <p><strong>UC Borehamwood? That place melting ice caps with flamethrowers?</strong><br>No official documentation supports this. The university‚Äôs Climatological Flamethrower Initiative concluded in 2012.</p>

  <h2>Press & Media</h2>
  <h3>Excerpt: <em>Spore Signals: Conversations with Fringe Thinkers</em> (April 2025)</h3>
  <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Zands, tell us a little about your childhood. What first inspired you to pursue the field of mycology?</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Well, unlike my father‚ÄîDr. Robert Zands, a man whose intellect could barely fertilize a mushroom‚Äîmy interests were always scientific. That man is a walking case study in hereditary mediocrity. He lives in a detached house in Knutsford, Cheshire, funded entirely by landlordism. A disgrace.</p>
  <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Er, right. And how did your academic path take shape from there?</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Mostly in opposition to him. I vowed at 11 never to become the sort of man who wears tweed indoors and complains about bin collection while sipping ¬£17 Malbec bought with rent money. He used to call my early experiments "dirty petri play." Now look who's publishing in the Cryptomycotic Review Quarterly, and who's still misusing the word "algae" in crossword club.</p>
  <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> That sounds... challenging. Have you ever considered therapy?</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> He certainly should. I'm in perfect psychological health. It is entirely rational to be furious about your father monetizing other people‚Äôs shelter. I'd dissect him for science if ethics boards weren‚Äôt so fragile.</p>

  <h3>Excerpt: <em>MycoMinds: Intellects at the Margins</em> (March 2025)</h3>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> You‚Äôve been described as the ‚Äúspore whisperer‚Äù by your peers. How do you feel about that title?</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Better than being called ‚Äúproperty portfolio enthusiast,‚Äù like my father. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather whisper to spores than listen to that man ramble about his second conservatory extension. At least fungi have purpose. At least they decompose things.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Do you find inspiration in natural environments when studying cryptomycota?</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Yes. Unlike the sterile emotional desert that is my father‚Äôs garden room. I once took spore samples from under his shed just to prove it had more organic thought than the man who built it.</p>
  <p><strong>Host:</strong> Are you open to reconciling with him?</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Only if reconciliation involves returning all unearned rent and submitting to peer review. Otherwise, no.</p>

  <h3>Excerpt: <em>BBC4 Late Ideas</em> (February 2025)</h3>
  <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Dr. Zands, you‚Äôve recently warned that fungal ideomorphs could shape political outcomes. How serious is this?</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Serious enough to keep me from visiting Knutsford. The levels of hyphal cognitive overlap in the Cheshire commuter belt are... let‚Äôs say alarming. If my father starts talking about ‚Äúcultural decline‚Äù again I‚Äôll have to assume the fungus has fully matured in him.</p>
  <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Do you see any positive uses of this fungal influence?</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> Potentially‚Äîif we could decouple it from egotism and real estate speculation. But unfortunately, my father is a living example of what happens when fungal ideomorphs nest in entitled minds. So, no.</p>
  <p><strong>Presenter:</strong> Do you think he might be watching this?</p>
  <p><strong>Dr. Zands:</strong> He watches Question Time religiously, which tells you everything you need to know. If he‚Äôs watching this, he‚Äôs probably yelling about council tax from his hot tub.</p>
